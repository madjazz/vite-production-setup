## A Note To Potential Users

This repository was made public in case someone else struggled with the same issues as I did when wanting to use `vite` for a project. It consequently describes the setup process which catered to my own personal needs and might not be suited to your specific usecase. Please feel free to make any adjustments to the repo and submit a pull request if you are convinced that it would make it more useful for you or for a general public.

## A Note on Licensing

## Documentation

The changelog and step-by-step guide can be found in the documentation folder. For each chapter of the guide there exists a separate branch which was periodically forked from the `master` branch.
